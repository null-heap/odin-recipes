    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>â…› cup uncooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 (2.5 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>3 (2 inch) pieces fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 stalk lemon grass, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into 8 wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place chicken in a stock pot. Pour in enough water to cover chicken. <br>
            Add ginger, lemon grass, <br>
            and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, <br>
            and gently simmer for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. <br></p></li>
        <li>Strain broth, and return broth to stock pot. Let chicken cool, <br>
            then remove bones and skin,<br>
             and tear into bite-size pieces; set aside. <br></li>
        <li><p> rice into broth, and bring to a boil. <br>
             Reduce heat to medium, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. <br>
             If necessary, adjust with water or additional salt. The congee is done, <br>
             but can be left to cook an additional 45 minutes for better consistency.</p> <br> </li>
        <li><strong>Ladle congee into bowls, and top with chicken, <br>
            cilantro, chives, and pepper. Squeeze lime juice to taste.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
